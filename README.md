# ContainerRemoteCodebackend
# Executors

This repository contains Dockerized executors for running code in different programming languages. Each executor is set up to run specific code in a containerized environment, ensuring isolation and consistency across executions.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

executors/
│
├── javascript/
│ ├── Dockerfile
│ ├── scripts/
│ │ └── script.js
│
├── python/
│ ├── Dockerfile
│ ├── scripts/
│ │ └── script.py
│
└── ... (other languages, if any)

### Getting Started

Follow these instructions to build and run the executors.

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/niteshsainicoder/ContainerRemoteCodebackend.git
cd executors
 2. Navigate to the Desired Language Directory
For example, to work with the JavaScript executor:

bash
Copy code
cd javascript
3. Build the Docker Image
Run the following command to build the Docker image for the executor:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t js-executor .
Replace js-executor with a name that suits your executor.

4. Run the Executor
To run the executor with a specific script:

bash
Copy code
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/scripts:/app/scripts js-executor
This command will mount the scripts directory from your host machine into the container and execute the script.

Adding New Executors
Create a New Directory: For the new language, create a directory under executors/.

Create a Dockerfile: Write a Dockerfile that defines the environment and steps needed to run the code.

Add Scripts: Place any sample or required scripts in a scripts/ subdirectory.

Update Documentation: Make sure to add any specific instructions for your new executor in this README.md.

Example Usage
Here's an example for the JavaScript executor:

Navigate to the javascript/ folder.
Build the Docker image:
bash
Copy code
docker build -t js-executor .
Run the executor:
bash
Copy code
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/scripts:/app/scripts js-executor
This will execute the script.js located in the scripts/ folder.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues, please check the following:

Ensure Docker is installed and running on your machine.
Verify the paths in your docker run command.
Ensure your Dockerfile is correctly set up with the necessary dependencies.
